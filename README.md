Creating a Power BI Dashboard
To create a dashboard in Power BI for Claire that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset, follow these steps:

Open Power BI Desktop.

Import the cleaned and transformed call center data into Power BI.

Create the following KPIs using DAX formulas:

Overall customer satisfaction
Overall calls answered/abandoned
Calls by time
Average speed of answer
Agentâ€™s performance quadrant (average handle time vs. calls answered)
Design an interactive dashboard with visualizations that showcase these KPIs and metrics creatively.

Add filters, slicers, and drill-through options for Claire to explore the data.

Save and publish the Power BI report to a location accessible by Claire.
DAX Formulas Used
Answered = CALCULATE(COUNT(Sheet1[Call Id]),FILTER(Sheet1, Sheet1[Answered (Y/N)]="Y"))
DayOfWeek = FORMAT(Sheet1[Date],"dddd")
Resolved (Y) = CALCULATE(COUNT(Sheet1[Call Id]),FILTER(Sheet1,Sheet1[Resolved]="Y"))
MorningCalls = 
CALCULATE(
 COUNTROWS('Sheet1'),
 'Sheet1'[TimePeriod] = "Morning"
) 
Same for other periods

Data Visualization Insights:
Most call satisfaction ratings are 3 and 4.
Average satisfaction rating decreased over three months, peaking in January and dipping in March.
Issue resolution rate was highest in January, dipped in February, and increased in March.
Majority of calls occur in the morning.
Joe has the highest average speed of answer.
Jim has the highest call resolution rate despite slower speed and higher call volume.
Becky has the slowest speed of answer but a higher call resolution rate, ranking 5th.
Martha has the highest speed of answer in the second position.
